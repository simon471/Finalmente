Consider the following Java class.

public interface TheGodModule{
  public Spell cast(int n);
}

public class Wizard implements TheGodModule{

  Spell[] spells;
  Potion[] potions;
  String name;
  int points=0;
  
  public Wizard(String name){
    this.name = name;}
    
  public void powerUp(){
    this.points = this.points + 10;
  }
  
  public Spell cast(int n){
    return this.spells[n-1];
  }
  
  public void hello(){
    System.out.println("Hi, my name is " + this.name + ". I am a Wizard.");
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Wizard TheGod = new Wizard("Harry Poppins");
    TheGod.hello();
  }
  
}

A.  Write a method for the Wizard class named "powerUp" that adds 10 to the field "points".

B.  Write a method "cast" that casts the n-th element of the "spells" array.  
    Include an interface (seperately) for the Spell class to insure your "cast" method will interact with the class.
    
C.  Write a "hello" method that prints an introduction stating the name of the Wizard.

D.  Write a main method for the Wizard class.  In it construct a wizard with name "Harry Poppins".  Use the hello() method.
