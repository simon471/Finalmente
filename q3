A.  Explain how digital signature works with public/private keypairs.

Ans: When you want to identify the file is yours, you can generate a public and private key for the file. The public key is 
     a encrypt code that release to the public, and the private key is to decrypt the encrypt code that you have made which 
     you won't release to public. So the private key can verify that the file is yours like a signature.

B.  Identify your favorite Java project this semester.
    Describe two things you learned by doing the project.
    Describe two ways in which the project could be improved or expanded.
    
Ans: My favourite Java project is the GUItest.
     I have learn't how actually interface is implements and used, also how to create a interface for a program.
     I think the project could be improved and expanded by writing more in depth graphical function that make the GUI more
     nice and user friendly. Also we can write a GUI for the programs we have write before.
    
C.  Describe two advantages of object-oriented programming.
    Describe two disadvantages of object-oriented programming.

Ans: advantages: easy to maintian and modify, provides a good framework for code libraries
     disadvantages: the size is larger than other program, the speed is slower mostly because of their size.
    
D.  Consider the following PYTHON code for the MNode class given below.
    What is the difference in the way Python and Java handle the declaration of datatypes?
    Explain the difference in how constructors are written in Python vs Java.
    Which language do you prefer?  Explain why.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    import hashlib

class MNode:

    pay=0
    left=0
    right=0

    def __init__(self, pay, left, right):
        self.pay=pay
        self.left=left
        self.right=right

    def merge(self, other):
        hashe=hashlib.sha256(self.pay+other.pay).hexdigest()
        return MNode(hashe,this,other)

    def getI(self, i):
        read=self
        bi=bin(i)[2:]
        for x in range(1, len(bi)):
            if bi[x]=='0':
                if read.left==0:
                    return 0
                else:
                    read=read.left
        
            else:
                if read.right==0:
                    return 0
                else:
                    read=read.right
        
        return read

Ans: The difference in the way Python and Java handle the declaration of datatypes are that Python doesn't need to declare the
     datatype when writing fields and methods, it can identifies the datatypes itself.
     
     The difference in how constructors are written in Python vs Java is that Python's constructors use __init__ other than 
     copying the name of the class into it. The fields of the object, it uses "self." to represent other than "this." that
     Java is using.
     
     I prefer to use Python because it is less complicated also less limitation when constructing a method, but for learning
     purpose Java is better because it makes you have a better concept and understanding of the structure.
